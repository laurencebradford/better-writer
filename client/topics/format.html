<h1>7 Formatting Tips for writing on the web</h1>
<p>Aside from syntax, language and grammar — there are certain formatting strategies I use when it comes to web-based writing. <em>(Emails, blog posts, sales copy, even an About page …)</em></p><p>These formatting tips make it easier for readers to go through an article. <em>Enjoy!</em> </p>
<h2>1. Underline hyperlinks only</h2>
<p>Depending on how old you are, <strong>you know that the traditional hyperlink is underlined and colored blue.</strong> And then, after visited, the color changes to purple.</p><p>In fact when you put up the most simple HTML page online, without any CSS styling, built into the browser styles <strong>still</strong> the blue underlined URL.</p><p>With all this being said, we have been unknowingly trained to associate underlined text (and blue, especially) to be a URL. </p><p>Have you ever been on a site, saw an underline, clicked it, and it went no where? Or, had trouble finding where the links were on the page?</p><p><em>Frustrating, right?</em></p><p>When it comes to formatting content, <strong>I only underline links.</strong> I love creating emphasis, but when I do so I avoid the underline.</p><p>As far as design goes, I always try to keep my url design choices similar to traditional hyperlink: a blue underlined text.</p><p>Because if you confuse people, you lose people.</p><p>I talk more about design choices further on this list.</p>
<h2>2. Use bold and italicizations for emphasis</h2>
<p>Nowadays we’re all so ADHD. Utilizing bold and italicizations helps keep people&#39;s eyes moving down the page.</p><p>I use this in email messages, too. </p>
<h2>3. Use bulleted/numbered lists and subheadings</h2>
<p>To help break up text, and make your writing easy to scan.</p>
<h2>4. Keep paragraphs short</h2>
<p>— so that rule about 5 sentence paragraph not true</p><p>Dense paragraphs tough to read on a mobile device.</p><p>big blocks of text are especially hard to read on mobile</p>
<h2>5. Keep sentences short, too</h2>
<p>Aside from being more concise, also helps with readability</p>
<h2>6. Put important links on separate line</h2>
<p>(especially in emails) .. Why? Because people open 51 percent of emails on their phone !! Always make important links easy to click because a little iPhone 4 + big fingers = hard to click</p>
<h2>7. make design choices your audience will understand</h2>
<p>doesn’t relate to writing, but design and content act together.</p><p>(i.e. avoiding crazy hover effects and JS transitions if you’re targeting those 65+)… example of this here (<a href="http://www.guillaumejuvenet.com/">http://www.guillaumejuvenet.com/</a>).. it’s cool but it takes thought to navigate the site</p><p>Obviously, this is a loose strategy to follow. In the end, rules are meant to be broken.</p>
